# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Jason Kim

I'm a Math & Computer Science major at Cornell University, graduating around May 2027.  
I'm passionate about two main things: **software development** and **quantitative trading**.

Beyond code and markets, I enjoy **martial arts** (boxing and Muay Thai), playing the **guitar**, and testing my edge in **poker**.
